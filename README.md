# Preact Pokeno

My mother runs recreational therapy sessions and asked if I could create her a web based Pokeno game.

I chose Preact because I'm comfortable in React but preferred trying something with smaller footprint.

## CLI Commands

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# test the production build locally
npm run serve

# run tests with jest and preact-render-spy 
npm run test
```
